## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/capstone-mtg-streamlit-app.git

OR simply clone it on github with the URL

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd capstone-mtg-streamlit-app

3. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
    python -m venv venv
4. Activate Virtual Environment
   ```bash
    venv\Scripts\activate  #Windows
    source venv/bin/activate #macOS/Linux
5. Install Required Dependencies:
   ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
6. Run the App:
   ```bash
    streamlit run mtg_streamlit/mtg_app.py

## ETL Pipeline
The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline is used to process the raw Magic: The Gathering dataset into a cleaned format (`cleaned_cards.csv`) that is used by the app.

### Steps to Run the ETL Pipeline
1. Navigate to the ETL script directory:
   ```bash
   cd etl
2. Should you have a more up to date csv file containing more recently released sets, name it cards.csv and replace the older version in the data folder at the root of the directory
3. Remove the cleaned_cards.csv file from the data folder
4. Run the etl script called load.py
   ```bash
   python load.py
5. Verify that the cleaned dataset (cleaned_cards.csv) is generated in the data directory.


## Technologies Used (The tech stack, not to be confused with "The Stack")
- **Python**: Programming language for the app.
- **Streamlit**: Framework for building interactive web apps.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization libraries.
- **Git**: Version control.

## Dataset
-The app uses a cleaned dataset of Magic: The Gathering cards, stored in [cleaned_cards.csv]
-Original Dataset found at https://mtgjson.com/downloads/all-files/
- I used the AllPrintingsCSVFiles as this was going to be the most difficult to clean
